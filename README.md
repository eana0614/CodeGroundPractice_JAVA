This repository is contain practice problem of CodeGround site.

 And, it is updated when i start solving problem.
 

 Problem 1. Choose a number ( O )
 	>> A XOR A XOR A XOR = A
 	

 Problem 2. Favorite Number ( O )
 	>> When participants get high points in the order of low points,
 			the highest point among these points is the minimum score required to win.
 	   So, all participant point + high point value(A) compare the minimum score required to win(B).
 	   		And if A >= B, this participant can win.
 	   		
 	   		
 Problem 3. Test Study ( O ) ( Very easy )
 	>> This problem simple. Sort scores ascending or descending.
 	   type ascending = add the K number of elements from the end
 	   type descending = add the K number of elements from the first
